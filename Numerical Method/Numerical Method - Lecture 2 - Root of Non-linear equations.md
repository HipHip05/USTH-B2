# Numerical Method - Lecture 2 - Root of Non-linear equations

## Non-linear equations

- Linear equations (first degree equation)
  - Algebraic equation in which each term is eather a constant or the product of a costant and **(the first power of) a single variable**
- **Non-linear equations**
  - Equations with exponents greater than one



## Roots of Non-linear equations

### Bracketing methods

#### Bisection

- The bisection method is a **root-finding method** that repeatedly bisects an **interval** and then selects a subinterval in which a root must lie for further processing
  - Very simple
  - Robust
  - Relatively slow
